///  The Lissajous visualization takes advantage of the PeaksSorter class, and renders a separate Lissajous figure for each pair of loud spectral peaks.
///
/// I have long sought to develop a music-visualization scheme that readily displays the harmonic relationship of the frequencies being played. My inspiration comes
/// from Lissajous figures generated by applying sinusoidal waveforms to the vertical and horizontal inputs of an oscilloscope. Inputs of the same frequency generate
/// elliptical curves (including circles and lines). Inputs of different frequencies, where one is an integer multiple of the other, generate "twisted" ellipses.
/// A frequency ratio of 3:1 produces a "twisted ellipse" with 3 major lobes. A frequency ratio of 5:4 produces a curve with 5 horizontal lobes and 4 vertical lobes.
/// Such audio visualizations are both aesthetically pleasing and highly informative.
///
/// Over the past several years, I have implemented many many such visualizations and applied them to analyzing music. Unfortunately, most suffered from being
/// overly complex, overly dynamic, and uninformative. In my humble opinion, this Harmonograph visualization strikes the right balance between simplicity (i.e., the
/// ability to appreciate the symmetry of harmonic relationships) and dynamics that respond promptly to the music.
///
/// The wikipedia article at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonograph describes a double pendulum apparatus, called a Harmonograph, that creates
/// Lissajous figures from mixing two sinusoidal waves of different frequencies and phases. This Harmonograph visualization uses just the two loudest spectrum
/// peaks to produce the Lissajous figure. That is, the loudest peak generates a sine wave of its frequency to drive the horizontal axis of our visual oscilloscope,
/// and the second-loudest peak generates a sine wave of its frequency to drive the vertical axis.
///
/// The Lissajous visualization uses spectral peaks selected from the spectrum[bin] input data.
